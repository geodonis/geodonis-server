notes:

- The scrap document today which includes lots of information about system design and I think part of that might be the access control system I want to use.
    I need to go through that and reiterate that and then review it to see if it actually makes sense. It's kind of a hodgepodge now.
    (Specifically I want the section actions and permission model number two along with the DB outline below it.)
