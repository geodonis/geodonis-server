# Parcade layer 6/20/25

On a layer of this virtual or parallel world, the parcade layer. It consists ofa bunch of venues, generall parks, where you can play the arcade games in the venues.

- Top level app: parcade app (which takes the place of the current discovery app).
    - open a venue, from which you can select games (maybe just pacman for now) or edit the venue (edit requires login)
    - create a venue. Here you create a new venue (requires login)
- create venue:
    - name it?
    - look for OSM objects (like a park)
    - download OSM data (footprint, paths)
- edit venue: 
    - create GPS track (no trail match)
    - measure existing trails with GPS

For starters I should just make the GPS track app and the upload for it.

Short Term:

- update site for deployment
    - maybe put under a different name? Parcade? Multiverse?
- deploy sight
- deploy pacman into site
