# 6/19/25

I'm working on a website that includes normal web pages and also some long running applications. I don't really like react. I prefer plain javascript and HTML.That means for the normal web pages I just want playing html web pages, which would compose most of the site. However I've always had trouble figuring out how to do access control.It seems like for normal web pages the standard is something like HTTP only cookies. However these are not good for long running applications since it's possible for the cookie to get invalidated somehow and then that page can no longer make requests to the back end.

For the long running client application (like a map editor) JWT is convenient. However if I choose just JWT, as far as I know, then I'm practically committing myself to having my entire website be an SPA using rect or something similar. 

What ways do you recommend I do access control for such a site? FYI my preferred back end is Flask. 

===========================

## A Hybrid Approach to Access Control in Flask for Mixed-Application Websites

For developers building websites that blend traditional, server-rendered pages with modern, long-running JavaScript applications, a hybrid access control model offers a robust and flexible solution. This approach leverages the security of HTTP-only cookies for standard web pages and the convenience of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for your long-running applications, all within a unified Flask backend. This combination addresses the common pitfalls of each method when used in isolation, providing a seamless user experience without forcing a full single-page application (SPA) architecture.

### The Best of Both Worlds: Cookies and JWTs

For the majority of your website, which consists of normal web pages, the traditional session-based authentication facilitated by **Flask-Login** and **HTTP-only cookies** is the recommended approach. This method is secure against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks as the cookies are not directly accessible to JavaScript.

For your long-running client applications, such as a map editor, **JWTs** managed by the **Flask-JWT-Extended** extension offer significant advantages. They are self-contained, carrying user information and permissions, which simplifies communication with your backend API. The concern of a cookie becoming invalidated and disrupting the application is mitigated by implementing an automatic token refresh mechanism.

### A Unified Authentication Flow

The key to this hybrid model is a single login process that caters to both authentication systems. When a user signs in through a standard HTML form, your Flask backend will perform the following actions:

1.  **Establish a standard session:** Use Flask-Login to create a secure, server-side session for the user, accessible across all standard web pages.
2.  **Generate a JWT:** Concurrently, create a JWT containing the user's identity and any necessary claims.
3.  **Store the JWT in an HTTP-only cookie:** This is a crucial step. By storing the JWT in an HTTP-only cookie, you prevent it from being accessed by malicious JavaScript, while making it automatically available for your long-running application's API requests.

This unified login ensures a smooth user experience. The user logs in once and can seamlessly navigate between the traditional and long-running parts of your website.

### Implementing the Hybrid Model in Flask

Here's a high-level overview of how to structure your Flask application to support this hybrid access control:

#### **1. Project Structure and Extensions**

Organize your project using Flask Blueprints to separate the concerns of your main website, authentication logic, and the API for your long-running application.

```
/your_project
    /app
        /templates
        /static
        /main
            __init__.py
            routes.py
        /auth
            __init__.py
            routes.py
        /api
            __init__.py
            routes.py
        __init__.py
    config.py
    run.py
```

Install the necessary Flask extensions:

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-Login Flask-JWT-Extended Flask-SQLAlchemy
```

#### **2. Initializing Extensions**

In your main application factory (`app/__init__.py`), initialize the extensions:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_login import LoginManager
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager

db = SQLAlchemy()
login_manager = LoginManager()
jwt = JWTManager()

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_object('config.Config')

    db.init_app(app)
    login_manager.init_app(app)
    jwt.init_app(app)

    # Register blueprints
    from .main import main as main_blueprint
    app.register_blueprint(main_blueprint)

    from .auth import auth as auth_blueprint
    app.register_blueprint(auth_blueprint)

    from .api import api as api_blueprint
    app.register_blueprint(api_blueprint, url_prefix='/api')

    return app
```

#### **3. User Model**

Define your User model with the necessary fields for authentication:

```python
from flask_login import UserMixin
from . import db

class User(UserMixin, db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(128))

    # ... other fields and methods
```

#### **4. Authentication Routes (`app/auth/routes.py`)**

In your authentication blueprint, handle both the session login and JWT creation:

```python
from flask import render_template, redirect, url_for, request
from flask_login import login_user, logout_user, login_required
from flask_jwt_extended import create_access_token, set_access_cookies, unset_jwt_cookies
from . import auth
from ..models import User

@auth.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # ... your user authentication logic ...
        if user and user.check_password(request.form['password']):
            login_user(user)

            # Create the JWT and set it in a cookie
            access_token = create_access_token(identity=user.id)
            response = redirect(url_for('main.profile'))
            set_access_cookies(response, access_token)
            return response
    return render_template('login.html')

@auth.route('/logout')
@login_required
def logout():
    logout_user()
    response = redirect(url_for('main.index'))
    unset_jwt_cookies(response)
    return response
```

#### **5. Securing Routes**

-   **Standard Web Pages (`app/main/routes.py`):** Protect these routes using Flask-Login's `@login_required` decorator.

```python
from flask import render_template
from flask_login import login_required
from . import main

@main.route('/profile')
@login_required
def profile():
    return render_template('profile.html')
```

-   **API for Long-Running Applications (`app/api/routes.py`):** Protect your API endpoints with Flask-JWT-Extended's `@jwt_required()` decorator.

```python
from flask import jsonify
from flask_jwt_extended import jwt_required, get_jwt_identity
from . import api

@api.route('/data')
@jwt_required()
def get_data():
    current_user_id = get_jwt_identity()
    # ... fetch and return data for the long-running application
    return jsonify({"message": f"Hello from the protected API for user {current_user_id}!"})
```

#### **6. Automatic Token Refresh**

To prevent your long-running application from being logged out due to an expired JWT, configure `flask-jwt-extended` to automatically refresh the token. In your `config.py`:

```python
import datetime

class Config:
    # ... other configurations
    SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key'
    JWT_SECRET_KEY = 'your-jwt-secret-key'
    JWT_TOKEN_LOCATION = ['cookies']
    JWT_COOKIE_SECURE = False # Set to True in production with HTTPS
    JWT_COOKIE_CSRF_PROTECT = True
    JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES = datetime.timedelta(minutes=15)
```

`flask-jwt-extended` provides mechanisms to refresh the token either automatically on each request or by providing a separate refresh endpoint. For long-running applications, the automatic refresh on each request is often the most seamless approach.

### Conclusion

This hybrid authentication strategy provides a sophisticated yet manageable solution for websites with diverse components. It embraces the security and simplicity of traditional session-based authentication for standard web pages while harnessing the power and flexibility of JWTs for modern, API-driven applications. By unifying these approaches within a single Flask backend, you can build a secure, user-friendly, and scalable website without being constrained to a single architectural paradigm.

====================

I would like a little clarification on a few points:

- Would I use csrf on the standard pages? On the long running application pages? In the past, I have had problems with the csrf going bad. I think I mispoke when I said it was a problem with the cookie. If the csrf token goes bad, I can't even get a request into the server to relogin.
- What are the security risks in the system you have outlined, as compared JWT on an SPA and with http only cookies and csrf on normal web pages.
- I have accessed the API from standard web pages, such as for login, I think. Would you recommend against doing this? 

====================

Of course. These are excellent and very important clarifying questions. Getting the details right on CSRF and the separation of concerns is critical for a secure and maintainable application. Let's break them down.

---

### 1. Clarification on CSRF Protection

You are absolutely right to be cautious about CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery). Your past frustration is common; a misconfigured CSRF system can be a major headache.

**Short Answer:** Yes, you should use CSRF protection on **both** your standard pages and your long-running application's API, but they are handled slightly differently.

**Standard Web Pages (using `Flask-Login`)**

For your traditional pages with HTML forms (login, profile updates, etc.), you should use a standard CSRF implementation like the one provided by the **`Flask-WTF`** extension.

* **How it works:** `Flask-WTF` generates a CSRF token and embeds it as a hidden field in your forms. When the form is submitted, the server validates that the submitted token matches the one it expects for that user's session.
* **Your "Bad CSRF Token" Problem:** This typically happens when a user has a page open for a very long time. The session on the server expires, but the page in their browser still has the old, now-invalid CSRF token. When they finally submit the form, the server rejects it.
* **The Solution:** The login form is a special case. The request to `POST /login` should itself be protected by a CSRF token to prevent an attacker from tricking a user into logging into the attacker's account. However, **validating this token should not require a pre-existing session**. The token should be generated when the login page is rendered and be valid for that form submission. If the user's session is expired and they are redirected to the login page, a new, valid CSRF token will be generated with the page, solving the "can't even re-login" problem.

**Long-Running Application Pages (using `Flask-JWT-Extended`)**

Your long-running app doesn't use HTML forms in the same way. It makes programmatic API calls (e.g., using `fetch`). Here, you leverage the built-in CSRF protection of `Flask-JWT-Extended`.

* **How it works:** When you configure `JWT_TOKEN_LOCATION = ['cookies']` and `JWT_COOKIE_CSRF_PROTECT = True`, Flask-JWT-Extended uses a "double submit cookie" pattern.
    1.  When `set_access_cookies()` is called, it sets two cookies: the `access_token_cookie` (which is `HttpOnly`) and an `csrf_access_token` (which is **not** `HttpOnly`).
    2.  Your JavaScript application needs to be written to read the value of the `csrf_access_token` cookie.
    3.  For every state-changing API request (POST, PUT, DELETE), your JavaScript must include this token in a header, typically `X-CSRF-TOKEN`.
    4.  The `@jwt_required()` decorator on the server will automatically verify that the token in the header matches the token in the cookie.

This protects your API because an attacker's malicious website cannot read the CSRF cookie from your domain to put it in the header, thus thwarting the forged request.

---

### 2. Comparative Security Risks

This is a fantastic question. Here is a comparison of the security posture of the three models.

#### **Traditional Model: HTTP-Only Cookies + CSRF**
* **Primary Strength:** Excellent protection against XSS-based token theft. Because the session cookie is `HttpOnly`, even if an attacker finds an XSS vulnerability, they cannot use JavaScript to read the cookie and steal the user's session.
* **Primary Weakness:** Relies entirely on correct implementation of CSRF protection. If you forget to protect a single state-changing endpoint, it is vulnerable.

#### **SPA Model: JWT in `localStorage`**
* **Primary Strength:** Immune to CSRF by design (since the browser doesn't automatically attach the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header like it does with cookies).
* **Primary Weakness:** Highly vulnerable to XSS-based token theft. If an attacker finds *any* XSS flaw on your site, they can inject JavaScript to read the JWT from `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` and send it to their own server. They now have the user's token and can impersonate them completely until it expires. **This is a significant and often overlooked risk.**

#### **Your Proposed Hybrid Model**
This model is arguably the most secure of the three, as it combines the strengths of both while mitigating their primary weaknesses.

* **JWT in `HttpOnly` Cookie:** You get the primary benefit of the traditional model. By placing the JWT in an `HttpOnly` cookie, **it is protected from being stolen via XSS**. An attacker cannot access it with JavaScript.
* **Built-in JWT CSRF Protection:** You get robust CSRF protection for your API via the double-submit cookie method described above. This is a standard, well-vetted pattern.
* **Relative Risk:** The main risk shifts from architecture to implementation. The system is more complex than either pure approach. A misconfiguration (e.g., forgetting to enable `JWT_COOKIE_CSRF_PROTECT`, failing to set cookies as `Secure` in production, or putting highly sensitive data in the JWT payload) could open up vulnerabilities. However, when configured as outlined, it effectively defends against both CSRF and XSS-based token theft.

### 3. Accessing the API from Standard Web Pages

You are correct that your "standard" pages might still use JavaScript to fetch data. The key is to be deliberate about which authentication system protects which endpoint.

**My Recommendation: Establish a Clear Boundary.**

Think of your Flask backend as serving two different types of clients:
1.  **The Browser as a Document Navigator:** This is for your standard pages. The user clicks a link, the browser makes a GET request, and your server returns a full HTML document. Form submissions are POST requests. These routes should be protected by `@login_required` and rely on the traditional `session` cookie.
2.  **Your JavaScript Application as a Client:** This is your long-running map editor. It's a programmatic client that lives on a single page and communicates with the backend by fetching data from an API. These API endpoints (e.g., under a `/api/` prefix) should be protected by `@jwt_required()` and rely on the JWT cookies.

**Can you make a `fetch` call from a standard page to the JWT-protected API?**

Yes, you can. When the user is logged in, their browser has **both** the `session` cookie and the JWT cookies. A `fetch` call from any page on your domain will automatically include all of them.

**So, should you do it?**

Generally, it's cleaner to maintain the separation. If a "standard" page (like a user dashboard) needs to dynamically load some data, you have two good options:

1.  **Create a "Web API" Endpoint:** Create an endpoint like `/dashboard-data` that is protected by `@login_required`. Your JavaScript on the dashboard page can `fetch` from this endpoint, and it will be authenticated using the standard session cookie. This is simple and consistent with the rest of your standard site.
2.  **Use the JWT API:** You *can* have the JavaScript on the dashboard `fetch` from `/api/dashboard-data` (protected by `@jwt_required()`). It will work. The main reason to avoid this is to prevent logical confusion. It mixes the two models and might make it harder to reason about your application's security and data flow down the line.

The login process is the bridge. A standard `POST /auth/login` form submission, protected by `Flask-WTF`, is the single action that creates **both** the `session` cookie (for the traditional site) and the JWT cookies (for the long-running app). After that, each part of your site can stick to its own authentication method.

======================

What's the difference between the CSRF protection as you describe and the same site protection, functionally speaking? Do they accomplish the same thing are is it different?

=======================

That is a superb question that gets to the heart of modern web security.

Functionally, **CSRF Tokens** and the **`SameSite` cookie attribute** both aim to solve the exact same problem—Cross-Site Request Forgery—but they accomplish it in completely different ways.

Think of it like securing a building:
* **`SameSite` Cookies** are like a new type of automatic gate at the parking garage entrance. The gate only opens for cars that are already inside the garage complex (same-site), and refuses to open for cars trying to enter directly from a different, unauthorized street (cross-site).
* **CSRF Tokens** are like a secret password you must show to the security guard at the front door. Even if your car gets into the garage, you still need to know the password of the day to be allowed inside the building to perform any actions.

They are two different layers of defense. Let's break down the functional differences.

---

### How They Work: Active vs. Passive Defense

#### CSRF Tokens: Active Verification
A CSRF Token is an **active** defense mechanism that requires your application to participate directly.

1.  **Server Generates a Secret:** Your server generates a unique, unpredictable token and gives it to the user's browser (either in a hidden form field or in a cookie for your JS app to read).
2.  **Client Must Present the Secret:** For any action that changes data (like submitting a form or a `POST` request from your map editor), the browser must send this exact token back to the server in a specific way (in the form body or in an HTTP header).
3.  **Server Validates the Secret:** Your server code actively checks if the token from the request matches the expected token. If it doesn't match or is missing, the request is rejected.

**Function:** This proves that the request originated from your own application, because a malicious third-party site has no way of knowing what the secret token is.

#### `SameSite` Cookies: Passive Browser Policy
The `SameSite` attribute is a **passive** defense mechanism. It's a rule you attach to a cookie, and you rely on the **browser** to enforce that rule. Your server application doesn't actively check anything.

1.  **Server Sets a Rule on the Cookie:** When you set a cookie (like a session or JWT cookie), you add the `SameSite` attribute. The most common values are:
    * `SameSite=Strict`: The browser will **never** send this cookie with a request that originates from another website. Not for images, not for forms, not even if you click a direct link from an email.
    * `SameSite=Lax`: (This is the default in modern browsers). The browser will send the cookie when the user navigates directly to your site (e.g., by clicking a link), but it will **block** the cookie from being sent on cross-site "subrequests," which include most CSRF attack vectors like a `POST` form submission from another domain.
2.  **Browser Enforces the Rule:** When a request is made from `evil-site.com` to your site, the user's browser looks at your cookie's `SameSite` attribute. If the rule says not to send it (`Lax` for a `POST` request, `Strict` for any request), the browser simply doesn't attach the cookie.
3.  **Server Receives an Unauthenticated Request:** Your server receives the forged request, but because the session cookie was withheld by the browser, the server sees it as a request from an anonymous user and rejects any action that requires authentication.

**Function:** This prevents the attack by never sending the user's credentials (the cookie) with the forged request in the first place.

### Key Functional Differences Summarized

| Feature | CSRF Tokens | `SameSite` Cookie Attribute |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanism** | Active, explicit server-side validation. | Passive, browser-enforced policy. |
| **How it Protects** | By requiring a secret that only your app knows. | By controlling when a browser sends a cookie. |
| **Granularity** | Protects specific, state-changing requests. | Protects an entire cookie, for all requests. |
| **Implementation** | Requires application logic (`Flask-WTF`, `Flask-JWT-Extended` CSRF). | Requires setting a simple flag on the cookie header. |
| **Browser Support** | Works in all browsers. | Not supported by very old, legacy browsers. |
| **User Experience** | Seamless. | `SameSite=Strict` can be disruptive (e.g., logging users out when they follow a link to your site). `Lax` is seamless. |

---

### So, Do They Accomplish the Same Thing?

Yes, for the most common types of CSRF attacks, `SameSite=Lax` (the modern browser default) provides effective protection. A standard cross-site `POST` form submission, which is the classic CSRF attack, will be stopped because the browser won't send the cookie.

### Why Not Just Rely on `SameSite`? Why Use Both?

This is the critical question. The modern best practice is **defense-in-depth**, which means using **both**.

1.  **Not All Browsers are Equal:** While modern browsers have excellent support, some users might be on older browsers or corporate networks with browsers that don't enforce `SameSite` policies correctly. CSRF tokens provide a fallback that works everywhere.
2.  **Protection Against Bugs:** A browser might have a bug in its `SameSite` implementation. Relying on two distinct protection mechanisms makes your application much more resilient.
3.  **Certain Attacks are Not Covered:** `SameSite=Lax` still allows cookies to be sent with cross-site `GET` requests that result from top-level navigation (clicking a link). If you have a critical action that is incorrectly exposed via a `GET` request (which is bad practice, but happens), `SameSite=Lax` won't protect you. A CSRF token system would still protect that action if configured properly.
4.  **Subdomain Vulnerabilities:** The definition of "site" can be complex. In some configurations, a request from a vulnerable subdomain (e.g., `vulnerable-blog.your-site.com`) might be considered "same-site" and be allowed to send cookies to your main app (`app.your-site.com`), bypassing the `SameSite` defense. CSRF tokens protect against this.

**Conclusion:** `SameSite` is a powerful, "free" first line of defense provided by the browser. CSRF tokens are a more explicit, application-aware second line of defense that you control completely. For a truly secure application, you should use both. The setup you are planning, using `Flask-WTF` for forms and `Flask-JWT-Extended` with its built-in CSRF protection for your API, automatically does this for you, giving you a robust, multi-layered defense.

================

I also want to support calling the API from a mobile application.How is this support added considering the hybrid approach we talked about uses a JWT as a http only cookie and the CSRF as a javascript accessible cookie. Do we attach the JWT in a different manner for an API call from mobile

I didn't think to ask this before, but it sounds like the current proposal also does not have a separate refresh and access token. Is that correct?

=======================
=======================
=========================

As I understand, the site currently supports session based authentication and CSRF tokens placed on the web pages. I want to make a modification for better support of (1) long running applications on a web page (like a map editor) and (2) mobile applications.

I got the following recommendations:

Server Setup:

- Access control:
    - Use JWT for access control, with Flask-JWT-Extended.
    - Do not use sessions
- Tokens:
    - JWT refresh token: long expiration (30 days?)
    - JWT access token: short expiration (15 minutes?)
- Server Access control actions for web pages:
    - Server places JWT refresh token in HTTP-only cookie.
    - Server places JWT access token placed in HTTP-only cookie.
    - Server places CSRF token placed in plain cookie.
    - The server automatically updates the access token based on the refresh token if the access token expires. (A access failure happens, it is caught by the server, new tokens issued and a redirect is sent to the browser to reissue tye request)
    - Client API calls must access the CSRF token and place it in the request header.
    - SameSite=Lax control is used. This means the browser includes the tokens on all requests originating from my site. It only includes the tokens on requests originating from a remote site if the request changes the page (location) to my site, meaning the browser will be on my site after the request is completed.  
- Access control for mobile applications:
    - Mobile app acquires a JWT refresh and access token through a login endpoint.
    - No csrf token is used.
    - Mobile app puts the access token (in header) on all normal API requests, while it is valid.
    - Mobile app gets a new access token, using the refresh token (in header) and the refresh endpoint, when the access token is about to expire or is expired. (I assume we could implement it either way.)
- General:
    - we can protect sensitive information by requiring "fresh" access tokens, meaning if the access token has been refreshed, it can not be used for these sensitive actions. The user must re-login.

Server configuration includes:
- API authorization for both header and cookie tokens.
- login form for website
- login API for mobile apps

Examining the current site code, please indicate the updates that are needed to use this new system. (Do not make the actual updates to the code.)
